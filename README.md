# Dio live Coding: Creating a meeting room manager with Java and Angular

During this class we learned how to produce a full-stack project using:

    The Java back-end knowledge we gained from previous projects.
    The Angular front-end knowledge we gained from previous classes.
    
You should find the following folders here:

     The meetingroom folder containing the Java back-end part of the project.
     The client-room folder containing the Angular frond-end part of the project.
     
The back-end part runs on the 8082 port and the front-end part runs on the 4200 port. It should be noted that only the front-end port has a content page.
